## Usage

### Creating a SELL Shop (You sell items TO players)

**Recommended: Set up BEFORE placing chest to avoid theft:**
1. Run: `/shop create sell 5` (sell for $5 each)
2. **NOW place a new chest** OR right-click an existing chest with items
3. Shop will detect item type from chest contents

**Alternative: Use existing chest:**
1. Place chest and add items (e.g., 64 diamonds)
2. Run: `/shop create sell 5`
3. Right-click the chest

Players will buy from your stock, and you earn money (collected via `/shop collect`).

### Creating a BUY Shop (You buy items FROM players)

**Option 1: With Item in Hand (Fast)**
1. Hold an item in your hand (the item you want to buy)
2. Run: `/shop create buy 10` (pay $10 each)
3. Place a new chest OR right-click an existing empty chest

**Option 2: Without Item (Material Selector)**
1. Run: `/shop create buy 10` (no item in hand)
2. Select category in GUI (Building, Resources, Food, etc.)
3. Select specific material
4. Place a new chest OR right-click an existing empty chest

Perfect for buying items you don't have yet! When players sell to your shop:
- Items go into the chest (only you can access it)
- Money is deducted from your Vault balance automatically
- You can retrieve items by opening the chest

### Trading with Shops

**As a Customer:**
- **SELL shops:** Shift-click for quick buy, or right-click for GUI
- **BUY shops:** Shift-click for quick sell, or right-click for GUI

**As Shop Owner:**
- Right-click your own shop chest to access inventory directly
- Add/remove items to restock SELL shops
- Collect purchased items from BUY shop chests

### Managing Your Shops

- `/shop info` - View shop details (look at shop)
- `/shop collect` - Collect earnings (look at shop)
- `/shop list` - List all your shops
- `/shop remove` - Remove a shop (look at shop)

### Restocking

### Configuration

**Towny Integration:**
```yaml
towny:
  enabled: true
  allowWilderness: true              # Allow shops in wilderness
  requireCommercialPlot: false       # Require commercial/embassy plots
  crossNationRestrictions: false     # Prevent cross-nation trading
  shopTax:
    enabled: true
    rate: 0.05                       # 5% of earnings go to town treasury
  transactionTax:
    enabled: true
    outsiderRate: 0.10               # 10% tax for non-town members
```

**Towns and Nations Integration:**
```yaml
townsandnations:
  enabled: true
  allowWilderness: false             # Require claimed territory
  shopTax:
    enabled: true
    rate: 0.05                       # 5% of earnings go to town treasury
  transactionTax:
    enabled: true
    outsiderRate: 0.15               # 15% tax for non-town members
  treasuryFunding:
    enabled: true                    # Allow town treasury to fund BUY shops
```

### How Taxes Work

**Shop Earnings Tax:**
1. Player collects earnings from SELL shop: `/shop collect`
2. Tax is calculated based on territory's shop tax rate
3. Player receives earnings minus tax
4. Tax is deposited to town/territory treasury
5. Notification shows: "Tax paid: $5.00 to [Town Name]"

**Transaction Tax:**
1. Outsider (non-member) buys/sells at a shop
2. Additional tax is calculated on the transaction
3. Buyer pays extra OR seller receives less
4. Tax is deposited to town/territory treasury
5. Notification shows: "Transaction tax: $2.00 ([Town Name])"

**Example:**
- Shop in "Oakville" sells diamonds for $100 each
- Oakville has 5% shop tax and 10% outsider transaction tax
- Shop owner collects $1000 earnings ‚Üí receives $950 ($50 to town)
- Outsider buys 1 diamond ‚Üí pays $110 ($10 to town)
- Town member buys 1 diamond ‚Üí pays $100 (no transaction tax)
