# Phase 3 Complete: Listing Creation Flow

## ✅ Completed Components

### New Files Created

#### 1. `ui/ListingConfigGUI.java`
**Purpose**: Configuration GUI for SELL listings

**Features**:
- Interactive inventory-based GUI
- Price input via chat (validates positive numbers)
- Quantity limit input (0 = unlimited)
- Item detection from chest contents or manual selection
- Cancel/Confirm workflow
- Real-time validation feedback
- Integration with SignRenderer and HologramManager

**User Flow**:
1. Player places SELL chest in shop mode
2. GUI opens with configuration options
3. Player sets price (required)
4. Player sets quantity limit (optional)
5. Player confirms → Listing created with visuals

#### 2. `ui/BuyListingConfigGUI.java`
**Purpose**: Configuration GUI for BUY listings

**Features**:
- Opens MaterialSelectorGUI first for item choice
- Price input via chat
- Buy limit input (total items to purchase)
- Interactive inventory GUI with item display
- Cancel/Confirm workflow
- Validation ensures item and price are set

**User Flow**:
1. Player places BUY chest in shop mode
2. Material selector opens → player chooses item
3. Configuration GUI opens
4. Player sets price (required)
5. Player sets buy limit (optional, 0 = unlimited)
6. Player confirms → Listing created with visuals

### Updated Files

#### `listeners/ShopModeListener.java`
- Wired up `openSellListingConfig()` to call `ListingConfigGUI`
- Wired up `openBuyListingConfig()` to call `BuyListingConfigGUI`
- Removed placeholder messages

## Key Implementation Details

### Session Management
Both GUIs use session tracking:
```java
Map<UUID, ConfigSession> sessions
```
- Tracks player configuration state
- Persists across GUI reopens and chat input
- Cleaned up on confirm/cancel
- Auto-cleanup on plugin disable

### Chat Input Handling
- `AsyncPlayerChatEvent` intercepted during price/limit input
- Event cancelled to prevent chat spam
- Number validation with error messages
- GUI reopens after valid input

### Inventory Management
- 27-slot inventory for clean layout
- Slots organized for intuitive UX:
  - SELL: Price (10), Limit (12), Item (14)
  - BUY: Item (4), Price (11), Limit (15)
  - Cancel (18), Confirm (26)
- Items update dynamically as config changes

### Validation
- Price must be > 0
- Quantity limits >= 0
- SELL listings can have null item (detected from chest)
- BUY listings require item selection
- Confirm button grayed out until valid

### Integration
- Creates `Listing` object with UUID
- Registers with `ShopRegistry`
- Creates sign via `SignRenderer`
- Creates hologram via `HologramManager`
- Associates with parent `ShopEntity`

## Dependencies

Both GUIs require:
- `BetterShopPlugin` instance
- `ConfigManager` for messages
- `ShopRegistry` for shop/listing management
- `ShopEntityManager` for validation
- `HologramManager` for visual creation
- `SignRenderer` for sign creation

## Messages Used

Config GUIs use these message keys:
- `prefix` - Message prefix
- `listing-created` - Success message with placeholders:
  - `{type}` - SELL or BUY with color tags
  - `{item}` - Item name
  - `{price}` - Price formatted to 2 decimals

## Testing Checklist

- [x] SELL listing: Set price only
- [x] SELL listing: Set price + quantity limit
- [x] SELL listing: Item auto-detection from chest
- [x] SELL listing: Manual item selection
- [x] SELL listing: Cancel workflow
- [x] BUY listing: Material selector → price → confirm
- [x] BUY listing: Set buy limit
- [x] BUY listing: Change item mid-config
- [x] BUY listing: Cancel workflow
- [x] Chat input validation (invalid numbers)
- [x] GUI state persistence across reopens
- [x] Integration with ShopModeListener
- [x] Sign and hologram creation
- [x] Registry association with ShopEntity

## Next Steps for Phase 4

Phase 4 will require updating `ShopCommand` to add:
- `/shop create {name}` - Create shop, enter mode
- `/shop mode [name]` - Enter/re-enter shop mode
- `/shop mode exit` - Exit shop mode
- `/shop rename {name}` - Rename shop
- `/shop delete` - Delete entire shop
- Update existing commands to work with Shop → Listing hierarchy

The command system needs to be aware of:
- ShopEntityManager for shop operations
- ShopModeManager for mode entry/exit
- Both ShopEntity and Listing concepts
- Backward compatibility with old syntax
