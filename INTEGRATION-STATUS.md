## üîß Config Example

```yaml
towny:
  enabled: true
  allowWilderness: true
  requireCommercialPlot: false
  crossNationRestrictions: false
  shopTax:
    enabled: true
    rate: 0.05  # Town gets 5%
  transactionTax:
    enabled: true
    outsiderRate: 0.10  # 10% for outsiders

townsandnations:

## üéØ How It Works

### Shop Creation

2. BetterShop checks active territory manager (Towny or TaN)
3. Validates wilderness permissions
4. Checks build permissions in claimed territory
5. Validates commercial plot requirements (Towny only)
6. Creates shop if all checks pass

### Transactions
1. Player buys/sells at a shop
2. Transaction tax calculated for outsiders
3. Tax paid to town/nation treasury
4. Player receives tax notification

### Earnings Collection
1. Shop owner collects earnings
2. Shop tax calculated based on territory
3. Tax paid to town/nation treasury
4. Owner receives net earnings
5. Owner receives tax notification

## ‚ú® Status

**Towny Integration**: ‚úÖ Fully functional and production-ready!

**Towns and Nations Integration**: ‚úÖ Fully functional and production-ready!

Both integrations are now complete with full API implementation. The plugin uses TownsAndNations 0.15.4 JAR as a system dependency for compilation. All territory features including permissions, taxes, and treasury operations are fully implemented.

**Setup Requirements**:
- Place `TownsAndNations-0.15.4.jar` in the project root for compilation
- Install TownsAndNations plugin on your server for runtime
- Enable the appropriate integration in `config.yml`

The plugin will automatically detect which territory plugin is installed and use the appropriate integration. Only one territory plugin should be enabled at a time in config.yml.
