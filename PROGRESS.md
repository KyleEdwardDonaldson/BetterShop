- Commercial plot checking (Towny)
- Territory restriction enforcement

**Files to Update:**

**New Messages Needed:**
```yaml
shop-created: "Shop '{shop_name}' created!"

shop-mode-exited: "Exited shop mode."
listing-created: "Listing created: {type} {item} @ ${price}"
shop-territory-assigned: "Shop assigned to: {territory}"
shop-territory-mismatch: "Must place listings in {territory}!"

### üíæ Phase 7: Data Migration (TODO)

**To Create:**
- `storage/DataMigration.java` - V1 to V2 migration logic
- Update `storage/ShopDataManager.java` - New save/load format

**Migration Steps:**
1. Detect V1 data format (no version field or version < 2)
2. Backup existing data to `.v1.backup`
3. Generate ShopEntity for each player (default name)
4. Convert old shops ‚Üí listings
5. Assign listings to generated shops

**New Data Format:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "shops": [...],
  "listings": [...]
}
```

### üß™ Phase 8: Testing & Validation (TODO)

**Test Cases:**
- Shop creation and mode entry
- Listing creation (SELL and BUY)
- Shop mode timeout and distance exit
- Territory restrictions
- Data migration from V1
- Backward compatibility
- Multi-shop management
- Shop deletion cascading

## Architecture Summary

### Data Model
```
ShopEntity (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< (N) Listing
    ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
  UUID              Location + Item
  Name              Type (SELL/BUY)
  Owner             Price + Earnings
  Territory         Stock (dynamic)
  Listings[]        Reserved Stock
```

### Shop Mode Flow
```
1. /shop create {name}
2. ShopEntity created with territory detection
3. Enter shop mode ‚Üí hotbar injection
4. Place SELL/BUY chests ‚Üí Config GUI
5. Listing created ‚Üí Associated with shop
6. Exit mode ‚Üí hotbar restored
```

### Registry Architecture
```
ShopRegistry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shopsById: UUID ‚Üí ShopEntity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shopsByOwnerAndName: UUID ‚Üí (Name ‚Üí UUID)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ listingsById: UUID ‚Üí Listing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ listingsByLocation: Location ‚Üí Listing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ listingsByShop: ShopUUID ‚Üí Listing[]
```

2. Update Phase 4 (Commands)
3. Implement Phase 5 (Territory)
4. Update Phase 6 (UI Components)
5. Create Phase 7 (Migration)
6. Test Phase 8 (Validation)

**Testing Priority:**
- Unit tests for ShopEntity and Listing
- Shop mode session tests
- Registry lookup tests
- Migration tests with sample data

**Documentation Priority:**
- Update README.md with new commands
- Update CLAUDE.md with architecture
- Add user guide for shop mode

## Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] ShopCommand needs full refactor for new command structure
- [ ] ShopManager (current) needs rename to ListingManager
- [ ] Update all event handlers to use Listing instead of Shop
- [ ] Update API classes for external plugin compatibility
- [ ] Create backward compatibility layer for old API methods
- [ ] Update TerritoryManager interface with new methods
- [ ] Messages.yml needs new placeholders and messages
- [ ] Config.yml needs full update with new structure

---

## Backward Compatibility Notes

**Maintained:**
- ShopType enum (deprecated but functional)
- Old config paths with fallbacks
- Registry methods for location-based lookups

**Breaking Changes:**
- Internal API: Shop ‚Üí Listing rename
- Data format: V1 ‚Üí V2 (migration handles this)
- Command syntax: `/shop create` now requires name

**Migration Path:**
- Auto-migration on first load
- Backup created automatically
- Old commands still work with warnings
- Default shop names generated for existing data
